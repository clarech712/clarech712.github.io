# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Until mid-June, I was a visiting student in Computer Science at the University of Oxford, where I was lucky to work on super exciting research under <a href='https://www.jakobfoerster.com/'>Jakob Foerster</a> at <a href='https://foersterlab.com/'>FLAIR</a>.

During the final year of my BSc, I am writing a senior honors thesis under <a href='https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~jsinapov/'>Jivko Sinapov</a> at the <a href='https://mulip.cs.tufts.edu/'>MuLIP Lab</a>. Watch this space!

After graduating in May 2025, I hope to remain in academia as a PhD student in Computer Science. I am broadly interested in artificial intelligence, especially reinforcement learning, robotics, and multi-agent systems, so that is what I am likely to pursue further.

In my free time, I am a polyglot bookworm, injury-prone runner, and avid cafe journaler.
